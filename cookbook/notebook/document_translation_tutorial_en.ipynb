    "# Document Translation Practice Based on ERNIE 4.5 and PaddleOCR\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Background Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Against the backdrop of globalization, the demand for cross-lingual communication is increasing, highlighting the growing importance of translation tasks. Especially with the acceleration of digitalization, the need to translate document images is on the rise. However, document image translation faces unique challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, document images often contain complex layout structures, including elements such as text, charts, and tables. This complexity poses significant difficulties for layout analysis. Traditional OCR technology often struggles to accurately extract text and preserve the original formatting when dealing with complex layouts. Therefore, layout analysis techniques are needed to extract the content from document images. Document image analysis is a technology for extracting structured information from document images, mainly used to convert complex document layouts into machine-readable data formats. This technology has broad applications in document management, information extraction, and data digitization. By combining optical character recognition (OCR), image processing, and machine learning algorithms, document analysis can identify and extract text blocks, headings, paragraphs, images, tables, and other layout elements from documents. It can generate structured document data, improving the efficiency and accuracy of data processing. PP-StructureV3, a leading document analysis tool developed by PaddlePaddle, has especially enhanced abilities in layout region detection, table recognition, and formula recognition. It also adds capabilities for chart understanding, restoring multi-column reading order, and converting results to Markdown files. It performs excellently on various types of document data and can handle relatively complex documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, multilingual translation itself presents challenges. There are significant differences in grammar, vocabulary, and cultural backgrounds between different languages. When dealing with long sentences and context-dependent translation tasks, traditional translation tools often struggle to deliver high-quality results. For document image translation tools, the challenge is how to accurately analyze the layout while providing smooth and faithful multilingual translation. This requires leveraging the capabilities of large language models. Based on this, this tutorial provides a practical guide for document translation using PaddleOCR and ERNIE 4.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is shown in the diagram below: First, use PP-StructureV3 to analyze the content of the document image and obtain a structured data representation. Then, process this into a Markdown-formatted document file. Finally, use prompt engineering to construct prompts and call ERNIE 4.5 to translate the document content. This approach can not only accurately recognize and analyze complex document layouts but also achieve high-quality multilingual translation services, meeting usersâ€™ document translation needs in different language environments.\n",

    "## 2. Environment Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Install the PaddlePaddle Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, multiple Paddle deep learning models will be used to accomplish document content recognition and translation. Therefore, you need to install the PaddlePaddle framework first. Please refer to the [installation guide](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install/quick?docurl=/documentation/docs/zh/develop/install/pip/linux-pip.html) to complete the installation. Here is an example command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python -m pip install paddlepaddle-gpu==3.0.0 -i https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/packages/stable/cu126/`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Deploy ERNIE 4.5 and Configure Key Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the ERNIE large language model is accessed via service requests, so it needs to be deployed as a local service. You can deploy the ERNIE model using the FastDeploy tool. FastDeploy is an open-source large model inference and deployment tool developed by PaddlePaddle. Please refer to the [FastDeploy official documentation](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/FastDeploy) for deployment instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, to test the availability of the translation model, you need to install the OpenAI SDK library before deploying the FastDeploy service. Execute the following command to install:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install openai`\n",
    "\n",
    "After deploying FastDeploy as a background service, you need to fill in the service URL in the configuration below, and use the script to test the service. If the output contains \"Test successful!\", it means the service is available. Otherwise, the service is unavailable and you should troubleshoot according to the error message."

    "PaddleOCR is a leading open-source document image analysis tool released by PaddlePaddle. Since its launch, it has become popular among academia, industry, and research communities due to its cutting-edge algorithms and practical industry applications. It has been widely adopted by many well-known open-source projects, such as Umi-OCR, OmniParser, MinerU, RAGFlow, etc., and has become the first choice for developers in the open-source OCR field. PaddleOCR not only integrates a large number of excellent algorithms and models for OCR and layout analysis, but also provides production-ready pipelines such as PP-OCRv5, PP-StructureV3, and PP-ChatOCRv4. By integrating multiple expert models, it can provide end-to-end solutions for specific problems.\n",
